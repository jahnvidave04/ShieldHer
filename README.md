Flutter Based app for Women Emergency Safety

Inspiration
As women, we have had experiences where we felt apprehensive walking home late at night. In fact, during this hackathon we ended up going back to our places around 2 am...

What it does
ShieldHer is an application that allows users to open a fake call screen where a recording of someone's real voice will play on the phone so it seems like the user is "calling" someone. The probability of someone attacking or kidnapping someone who is on the phone is much lower than someone walking alone, as the person on the other can know immediately that something has happened. If the user is still feeling uneasy, there is a hidden button on the fake call screen that will send their location to people in their trusted contact list.

How we built it
Frontend: Flutter framework and Dart programming language (so the app is compatible with Android, iOS, and web) Backend: Java spring boot and H2 database Version control and management: Git More technologies: Google Maps, audioplayers driver, Android Studio, vsCode, Xcode, Figma for UI

Challenges we ran into
The audio was very hard to implement into the application, Flutter was a hard learning curve for most members as they had never used it before. We are also a beginner hackathon team, so we were not very experienced with the pacing and workload of a 37 hour hackathon.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
ShieldHer is an innovation app that is built entirely from scratch and not a development of any existing product. We performed integration testing to ensure coding standards!

What we learned
Flutter was the main learning curve along with building a dynamic app. 3 members were completely new to Java spring boot. We learned how to build a full-stack project.

What's next for SheildHer
More robust Google Maps integration
Handle more traffic
Emergency SOS call
Recording from front and back cameras
Automated text messages
